# Lab 08 - 2-Players Zero-Sum Games

The goal of this is lab is to implement two algorithms to find equilibriums in 2-players zero-sum games. 

TODO:
* fill missing code in: 
  * `saport.minimax.solvers.mixed`
  * `saport.minimax.solvers.pure`
* run `minimax_example_XX.py` to test your code (make sure all elements of the output make sense, it will be graded!)

## SAPORT

SAPORT = Student's Attempt to Produce an Operation Research Toolkit

Includes:

* two-step simplex
* knapsack solver
* integer

To run functional tests from the `tests` subdirectory, run commands with a correct `PYTHONPATH`, e.g.

`PYTHONPATH=. python tests/simplex/test.py`
