# Lab 12 - AHP-EVM

The goal of this is lab is to use AHP-EVM method to solve three assignments.

TODO:
* write solutions to the assignments on paper, scan them and put into files, e.g. "zad1.pdf", etc.

or

* solve the assignments in python in "zad1.py", etc.

Either way you may find the "evm.py" helpful to calculate the principal eigenvector using the networkx library.
You may import it ("import evm" and use the methods directly or run it directly from your command line)
